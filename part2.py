PART 2

Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer n. The program will then print the sum of the first n positive cubes.

For example, if the user types in 4, the program should print 100 (since 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 100).

n = int(input('Choose a positive whole number: '))

for i in range(n+1):
